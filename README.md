Foundations Course Project 1 - Landing Page

Keep notes of what I learned during this project, and also, things to keep in mind.

## div needs content for css to be applied

- If the div container has no sizeable content, then it will not consume any space on the page. 
- For example, if you try to apply 'background-color' to an empty 'div' container, it will not show on the page.
- You can specify the height (and or width) of the container for the bg-color to show on the page.
- Or if the container has some elements, such as buttons, inputs, or 'ul' with 'li' that have bullets for list style, these elements will consume space on the page by default, and the css will be applied accordingly.
